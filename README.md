# DoublyLinkedList
My Doubly Linked list I created for my Data Structures class.

We were tasked with creating a complete Doubly Linked List that emulated what Java does with their Linked List Class.

The three files included are the ListNode, LinkedList, and the LinkedListDriver.

The ListNode class defines what each item of the linked list looks like, there is a next, previous, and value.
The LinkedList class defines methods used for the Linked List 
The Driver class highlights how the list works and its different capabilities.
